#Findings:
After intensive exploration of the data, the following findings were acquired:
1.Most rides are made at 8am and 5pm. This could be explained by the fact that people go to work and go back home at the said times.
2.Most rides are made on the last day of the month which was 28th February.
3.Most of the riders are subscribers.
4.Most riders are between 30 and 35 years old.

Key insights for presentation

Recommendations

2. There being fewer female riders, the company should do more advertising to attract more female customers and potentially subscribers.
